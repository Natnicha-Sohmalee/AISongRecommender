## Environment

This project uses a virtual Python environment (venv) to control which packages 
have been downloaded and standardize across multiple machines.

To activate Unix/Linux: <br>
    * ```cd /AISongRecommender ```<br>
    * ``` source AISongRec/bin/activate ```

To activate windows: <br>
* ```cd \ AISongRecommender ```<br>
* ``` .\powershellEnv\Scripts\```

## Data Collection
With limited datasets available, a large part of this project was creating our own training and testing sets. This was done
using the Spotify Web API and wrapper library Spotipy. Our model was trained on a dataset aggregated from mood labeled playlists 
created by various Spotify users. The testing set is an aggregation of songs from multiple playlists from Michael's account.

All data engineering related code can be found in the SpotifyWrapper.py file.

Final training set:

## Model
The Model is a Keras sequential classifier with 10 input features and 4 outputs (Happy, Sad, Calm, Energetic). It features
two dense layers with relu and softmax activation functions and the Adam optimizer. When classifying all 4 moods the model ranged from 
~74-76 % accuracy and an F1-Score of ~73%. We found this reasonable as the feeling that one song elicits is often subjective with 
only slight variation between Calm/Sad and Happy/Energetic. When predicting opposites such as Energetic/Sad it was much higher in with
accuracies in the mid 90's. 

   
## Hear the Results 
This part always brings the biggest smile to my face!! Its so cool being able to listen to music I like generated by code that I wrote. Screw accuracys, F-Scores, and MSE's... go listen!
