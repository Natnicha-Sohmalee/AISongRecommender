# Sort Songs into Genres
This branch is the result of some side work that I did for a friend. He had 3500 liked songs on his Spotify account, and had always figured that it was too much work to try and turn them into playlists even though he wanted to. 

As an offshoot of the main branch of AISongRecommender, I was able to find the most popular genres of music that he listended to, create playlists for each, and then write them to his account.
